# G.A.M.M.A. THE THING
A big project that aims to fix and streamline GBOOBS and the Actor Damage Balancer from G.A.M.M.A.

### FEATURES
- **FULLY HIJACKED** Anomaly's damage to the player system.
  + You can't become immune to damage anymore.
  + Damage to armor now scales ONLY with your armor protection, instead of being offsetted by artefacts or boosters.
  + An **ACTUAL HEALTH GATING** mechanic.
- (Almost) Completely configurable via .ltx files in "gamedata\configs\plugins\"
  + This includes but it's not limited to:
    - Particles on hit, for the player/NPCs/monsters.
    - Player resistances and damage scaling.
    - Per NPC properties (such as GBO armor, damage scaling, etc).
    - Per Monster properties (such as ammo multipliers, damage scaling, crit spots, crit multipliers)
- Fixes for a variety of crashes and annoyances.
- Monsters can be subject to **overpenetration**, which heavily reduce their damage taken (Snipers ignore this rule)
- NPCs' armor was split into only Head/Body instead of being per bone (i.e. armor in the left eye is independant from the rest of the head)
- #### *FIXED MULTIHITS, BOTH FOR THE PLAYER AND THE NPCS/MONSTERS*

### TO-DO
- Clean up code in general.
- Fine tune balance in general.
- Remove .338 Lapua Magnum.
