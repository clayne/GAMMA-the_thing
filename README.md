# G.A.M.M.A. THE THING
Designed to fix vanilla Anomaly's damage to the player and also allow easier end-user modding.

### FEATURES
- **FULLY HIJACKED** Anomaly's damage to the player system.
  + You can't become immune to damage anymore.
  + Damage to armor now scales ONLY with your armor protection, instead of being offsetted by artefacts or boosters.
  + An **ACTUAL HEALTH GATING** mechanic.
- (Almost) Completely configurable via .ltx files in "gamedata\configs\plugins\"
  + This includes but it's not limited to:
    - Particles on hit, for the player/NPCs/monsters.
    - Player resistances and damage scaling.
    - Per NPC properties (such as GBO armor, damage scaling, etc).
    - Per Monster properties (such as ammo multipliers, damage scaling, crit spots, crit multipliers)
- A bunch of options in MCM.
  + This will most likely be removed shortly. Except for the debug option and cosmetic toggles.

### TO-DO
- Clean up damage to mobs code.
  + Fix Claw artefact not dropping meat when killing mutants.
  + Fix Miser's Skull not dropping money on headshot kills.
  + Fix Boar/Flesh crit spots (This implies a revamp of how monsters are processed maybe).
- Get better balance.
- Clean up access to the MCM.
- Remove .338 Lapua Magnum.
